Hello, I‚Äôm Oguz from Turkey! ‚úåÔ∏è

I‚Äôm a freelance full-stack developer who‚Äôs kinda obsessed with JavaScript (TypeScript) and frameworks like React, Next.js, and Nest.js. I love building apps that are fast, stable, and not super complicated to maintain. Sometimes I mess around with e-commerce stuff and even a bit of blockchain... anything that sounds interesting or challenging!

Take a look at my repos to see what I‚Äôm up to, or just say hi if you want to chat about coding or possible collaborations! I‚Äôm always happy to meet cool people and exchange ideas. ‚ö°
